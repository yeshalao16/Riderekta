## Project Overview
This repository contains the codebase for the Riderrekta laundromat management and delivery system. 
The system is designed to serve three main user roles: 
- **Customers** (for ordering and tracking laundry services).
- **Employees** (for processing orders, updating status, and managing inventory).
- **System Administrators** (for creating new user accounts and general system configuration).

## Core Functional Requirements
- User Authentication (Login for all roles, Customer Sign-up).
- Order Management (Creation, Status Tracking, Order Details).
- User Profile Management (Editing and updating personal information).

## Setup
We are using the `main` branch as the default. Development tasks are managed using an Agile/Scrum approach, with work being pushed to feature branches and merged into `main` after review.
